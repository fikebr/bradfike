            "For 23 years I have worked for myself as an independent Remedy developer. I have worked for companies of all sizes, from Hilti Inc to Dell. I have worked on all phases of the development life-cycle from requirements gathering to production support. Every project is a new challenge that I was able to overcome.",
            "I particularly excel in the requirements gathering phase of projects, in buiding custom Remedy applications outside of the ITSM application and in building integrations to existing applications.",
            "I am looking to leave the independent consulting world. To find a project and team that will allow me to stay in Houston, TX.",
            "Even though the majority of my professional experience has been as a Remedy my next project need not be a Remedy project. To that end I have recently acquired a Full-Stack MERN certification and I plan to add a ServiceNow Developer Certification to my resume.",
            "Personally, to address my recent employment gap, I was forced to take time away from work first due to Covid-19 and then to care for my mother-in-law during her battle with cancer. I am now ready and eager to get back to work."
